# Welcome to My Portfolio Page

I borrowed the web design idea from https://brittanychiang.com/, but I technically implemented it on my own, from scratch using React and the React-Bootstrap framework. 

You can check how it looks at https://mchekin.vercel.app/.

I'm currently looking for a job, so if you are interested, don't hesitate to contact me.
